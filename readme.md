## Solving Problems, One Quirk at a Time

I'm a problem-solving enthusiast who thrives on turning ideas into impactful solutions. if it needs building, automating, or blockchain-ing, I‚Äôm your go-to. From whipping up insurance aggregators to creating blockchain voting systems, I‚Äôve been the architect behind some pretty cool (and occasionally chaotic) projects.

When I‚Äôm not wrestling with APIs or convincing computers to behave, I‚Äôm probably daydreaming about ways to outsmart them. My mantra? ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs broken, I‚Äôll fix it. If it‚Äôs not broken, I‚Äôll make it better‚Äîand probably add a feature or two for fun. üåö‚Äù

Got a wild idea or a project that needs a touch of brilliance (and maybe a sprinkle of madness)? Hit me up‚Äîlet‚Äôs create something unforgettable together!

### 1) Resume Tailoring Automation Tool

**Project Overview**:
The Resume Tailoring Automation Tool is a sophisticated automation solution designed to optimize the job application process for users. The tool automatically customizes resumes and cover letters to match specific job postings, saving users valuable time. By leveraging OpenAI and LangChain, the tool generates tailored resumes that are then converted into DOCX files and uploaded to a Google Drive folder. Once the process is completed, a Slack notification is sent to inform the user with a link to the tailored resume.

**Year Developed:** 2024

**Project Description:**
The Tailoring Automation Tool streamlines the resume customization process for job applicants. It takes job descriptions and user resumes, then automatically tailors them to match the job requirements. The tool performs the following steps:

Resume Tailoring:

Using OpenAI's language model and LangChain to process job descriptions and user resumes. The tool adjusts the language, skills, and experience in the resume to fit the specific job posting.
Docx files are generated for the tailored resumes, ensuring they are compatible with traditional job application systems.
Google Drive Upload:

The tailored resume is automatically uploaded to a designated Google Drive folder for easy access and sharing.
The tool uses the Google Drive API to handle file uploads programmatically, organizing resumes in folders by job application.
Slack Notification:

After the resume tailoring process is complete, the tool sends a notification to a Slack channel. This notification includes a message stating that the process is finished, along with a direct link to the tailored resume stored on Google Drive.
The Slack API is used to send the notification, providing a seamless and efficient way for users to receive updates.
Automation Workflow:

The entire process, from resume tailoring to file upload and notification, is automated. Scheduled jobs handle the routine tasks, ensuring that users can rely on the tool to complete their applications in an efficient manner.

**Use Case:**
This tool is ideal for job seekers who want to apply to multiple positions without spending time tailoring their resume for each application. By automating the process, users can increase the speed and efficiency of their job search, all while ensuring that their resumes are aligned with the specific requirements of each job posting.
